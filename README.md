# TDT4136 â€“ Introduction to AI

Consists of two exercises:
1. Implement the `A*`-algorithm on a pixel grid with varying pixel costs. Consists of the actual implementation and the creation of a visualization module used to visualize the results.
2. Implement the `minimax`-algorithm with a layer of `alpha-beta`-pruning on top. Implemented on a game framework not developed by myself.
